# Kubernetes

**Workload:** stateless `Deployment`; scale freely.

**Ports to declare**

| Name | Port | Protocol | Expose via Service? |
|---|---|---|---|
| `grpc` | `8080` | TCP (HTTP/2) | Yes — `checkout-service` dials `email-service:8080` |

**Service DNS name expected by callers:** `email-service` (`checkout-service`: `EMAIL_SERVICE_ADDR=email-service:8080`). `recommendation-service` also listens on `8080` — different Service, no clash.

**Probes**

```yaml
readinessProbe:
  grpc: { port: 8080 }
  initialDelaySeconds: 3
  periodSeconds: 5
livenessProbe:
  grpc: { port: 8080 }
  periodSeconds: 10
  failureThreshold: 3
```

**Graceful shutdown:** the process runs as PID 1 and installs no `SIGTERM` handler. The kernel ignores unhandled signals for PID 1, so `SIGTERM` is dropped and every pod termination waits the full grace period before `SIGKILL`. Set `terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 5` (the service has no in-flight work worth waiting for). A proper fix is a `signal.signal(SIGTERM, …)` handler or a tiny init (`tini`) in the image.

**Security context**

```yaml
securityContext:
  runAsNonRoot: true
  runAsUser: 100
  runAsGroup: 101
  allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
  capabilities: { drop: ["ALL"] }
  readOnlyRootFilesystem: true   # verified in-cluster; no writable /tmp was needed
```

**Resources** — requests sized from measured idle usage in the test stack (see the chart's `values.yaml` for limits):

```yaml
resources:
  requests: { cpu: 100m, memory: 64Mi }
  limits:   { cpu: "500m", memory: 192Mi }
```

**Config / secrets:** none today. If this ever becomes a real mailer, SMTP credentials belong in a `Secret`.

**Telemetry:** pushed, not scraped — OTLP/gRPC to Alloy (`global.monitoring.otlpEndpoint`), profiles to Alloy `:4040`. Metrics carry `job="email-service"` and `instance=<pod>`; no scrape annotations or `ServiceMonitor` are needed.

**Helm chart:** [`platform-demo-helm/email-service`](https://github.com/platform-boutique/platform-demo-helm/tree/main/email-service) (built on the shared `platform-common` library chart). It ships with HA defaults — 2 replicas,
HPA, PodDisruptionBudget, topology spread, NetworkPolicy, restricted pod security context, probes and the full env contract (see Configuration) —
and was verified under the `restricted` Pod Security Standard on the earlier local 3-node kind cluster (since retired). The platform now targets AWS EKS, where this chart has not been deployed or verified yet.

**Deployment and admission policies:** Argo CD deploys the chart from `platform-demo-helm` (`envs/<env>/values/email-service.yaml` pins the image digest; promotion is a pull request). In the cluster Kyverno enforces, for this service: pods named `app.kubernetes.io/name: email-service` that run under the ServiceAccount of the same name (Cilium derives the network identity from that label), an image from this repository pinned by digest and signed by our release pipeline, a read-only root filesystem, resource requests and a memory limit, readiness and liveness probes and no API token. The Helm CI evaluates the rendered chart against these policies before merge; see [`platform-demo-helm/policies`](https://github.com/platform-boutique/platform-demo-helm/tree/main/policies).
